Hello, my name is James, Bond. JAMES BOND.
I am a secret agent working for MI6.
My mission is to save the world from evil villains.
I have a license to kill and I always ensure I do a thorough job.
In my line of work, discretion is key, and I always stay one ahead of my enemies. They never see me coming
I always have a gadget or two up my sleeve, and I never leave home without my trusty Walther PPK.
